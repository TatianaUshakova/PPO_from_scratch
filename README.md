**My implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Reinforcement Learning algorithm from scratch, following the algorithm in the original OpenAI paper.**

Also there are very unfinished notes on RL (I will add new material I learned recently soon)

To be added soon (polishing the last details): 

- new topics to the notes
- plots for comparison of my implementation of ppo and stable baseline ppo

gym style snake game: I created the customized env that is fully compatible with RL libraries and can be used interchangible with OpenAI's gym env

Available at https://github.com/TatianaUshakova/Gym_Style_Snake

to be added there
 - experiments with custom design of reward funcitions, structure of learning and partial information availability to identify ways of more efficient learning + notes-reflection about that
