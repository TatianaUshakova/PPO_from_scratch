My implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Reinforcement Learning algorithm from scratch, following the algorithm in the original OpenAI paper.

Also there are very unfinished notes on RL (I will add new material I learned recently soon)

To be added soon (polishing the last details): 

- gym style snake game - created my own env to make sure I understood it fully
- new topics to the notes
- plots for comparison of my implementation of ppo and stable baseline ppo
- experiments with custom design of reward funcitions for faster and more robust learning with smaller amount of info available/partial information about the state only, and the notes-conclusion about that
