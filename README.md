My implementation of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) Reinforcement Learning algorithm from scratch, following the algorithm in the original OpenAI paper.

**Current status**:  
Still debugging and polishing â€” currently investigating a bug in policy loss implementation

The core structure is in place though.

Also there are very unfinished notes on RL (I will add new material I figured out soon)
